  <h1>ID: "The Siren"</h1>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Secondary Codename: Fenrir-9</p>
  <p>DOB: 1/1/27 BR.</p>
  <p>Member Since: Founding (1/31/968)</p>
  <p>Species: Asteronyx cosmica</p>

  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>The Siren is one of two primary frontline fighters of the group, alongside The Blade. While The Blade specializes in melee combat, The Siren specializes in ranged combat, utilizing their war form's flight and self-developed Local-Global Detachment Chrysalization magitech in order to capture grounded enemies if deadly measures aren't deemed absolutely necessary. The Aspida House's basement area, which connects to a local cave system, allows for the secret storage of chrysalized subjects, where they can be studied to detemine their affiliations and motives. Currently, over 200 subjects are stored in the cave.</p>
  <p>All current combatants of the New Txamsem agree that their roles as battlers are forged out of necessity and by design impermenant. Planned cessations to combat operations, following Operation Yagatarasu and the global decolonization effort, will allow the current combat operatives to retire to other positions of their choice. As a wannabe space engineer, The Siren plans on building a rocket for the non-Earthling members of the group to return to space; in particular, to create a permanent residence on the planet Mercury, with a linked station (via Triskelion) to Primus for visitation.</p>
  <p>As one of the co-caretakers of Aspida House alongside The Mist, The Siren oversees the transport of goods to and from the House, as well as numerous other transportation programs among the group.</p>
  <!-- She was there for me before the event that changed everything. She... might've been the ONLY one there for me, back then. My brother was too busy with his jobs to even talk to me and everyone else was off doing their own thing. But she visited pretty often; whenever she did, she'd basically find the nearest couch and just lie there while I cooked or cleaned, occasionally looking over at me and smiling. She couldn't speak back then, but if she could, it'd probably be about the same inane things we talk about now. Apparently I was one of the only humans to encounter her in that state and survive. -->
