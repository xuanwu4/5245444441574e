  <h1>ID: "The Rust"</h1>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Secondary Codename: Caduceus-5</p>
  <p>DOB: 1/1/27 BR.</p>
  <p>Member Since: Founding (1/31/968)</p>
  <p>Species: Asteronyx cosmica</p>
  <p>Call Command: Analyze</p>
  <p>Height: 4'11"</p>
  <p>Weight: 3367 kg.</p>
  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>The Rust is the designated information specialist of the group. They accompany The Hare on infiltration missions, spy on enemy parties, perform large-scale database hacks, and work in close association with a multinational spy network. They have a policy of "scrap no data", as anything they collect, no matter how inconspicuous, could be important; this was the original reason the Tower database system was developed in the first place.</p>
  <p>The invaluable cultural and societal data The Rust has collected over the years is planned to go on public display in a museum of their own creation after the completion of Operation Yagatarasu, though this is proclaimed by some members to be wishful thinking, as the Operation does not signal the end of the criminalization of New Txamsem activities.</p>
  <p>The Personal Orinthopter Assistant project, codenamed Project Thunderbird, has allowed the deployment of remote-controlled information gathering robots across the continents surrounding The Rust's and The Weaver's bases. From these devices, we have observed over 25 undercover Citadel operations taking place across the two continents, and will continue to gather data on (and in certain cases, interfere with) these operations.</p>
  <p>Both The Hare and The Rust are apt roboticists, with the former specializing more in hardware design, and the latter specializing more in software design. The Adam AI project being undertaken by The Hare was started on the advice of The Rust, who has worked to ensure its success alongside other side projects.</p>
