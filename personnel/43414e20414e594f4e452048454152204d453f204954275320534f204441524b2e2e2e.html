  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p style="color:grey">Note: the content in this page has not been updated recently and may be out of date.</p>
  <p>The Sparrow is one of the five founding members of our team, along with the four specimens of the starsent species. During the period where The Blood Moon was missing, he held no associations with any of the other three, choosing to avoid them at all costs, but since his return The Sparrow has grown amicable to the group once more. Despite this amity, The Sparrow was irrevocably changed the day The Blood Moon originally went missing, and self-admittedly has never been the same since. As The Blood Moon is his immediate superior, due to his biology, he is dependent on The Blood Moon's presence to maintain his determination and will to live.</p>
  <p>This is not the only biological dependency The Sparrow has on a close contact. A close supporter of the team (who, if not for external circumstances, would join), having been the one to create The Sparrow, endowed him with his memories and physiology. There are several theories among the group as to what might happen if absolute separation, like that of which The Blood Moon endured, occured to this entity, cutting off The Sparrow's access to the features of him he depends on. Most commonly, we think it might result in a version of The Sparrow with willpower and determination, with a purpose and motive, but no memory, personality, or emotion.</p>
  <p>Regardless of these dependencies, the unfaltering proficiency in martial and aerial combat as well as incredible intellect and versatile skills provided by The Sparrow make them an invaluable member to the team. What's more, his divine nature could provide us a way to access the plane of light unavailable to any other member of the group thus far, given that the plane is under divine control.</p>
