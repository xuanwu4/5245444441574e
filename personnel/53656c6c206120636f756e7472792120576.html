  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>The Mist, though not the leader of the organization, is the founder of the New Txamsem. As of the Convergence event and discovery thereafter of the conditons of a sponsored time-travelling party, she called upon The Blood Moon to right the injustice he had wrought upon the victims trapped within the plane of light. Originally, the New Txamsem was organized as an effort to reunite the four Asteronyx cosmica ("Starsent") species members, as the last of their kind, to better ensure their survival, and work together to develop a way to access the plane of light.</p>
  <p>Due to the March 968 attack by Pantheon operatives that destroyed their "safe haven" town that they were residing in and killed former member The Sparrow, The Mist abdicated her position of leadership (which she held for the two months prior) to The Blood Moon, who she trusted more in conducting strategic defensive operations. Her final orders as leader were to two members who signed on following the attack- The Tortoise and The Hare- to begin drafting a magic-free planar teleportation technology. The designs for this technology later developed into the current Triskelion project.</p>
  <p>The Mist has an untarnished record of effective deployment in combat, but refrains from frequent appearances during battles for ethical reasons. She, along with the leadership of the New Txamsem, see her deployment as a last resort, due to the dangerous antimemetic effects of her presence.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, she along with The Siren have worked to found Aspida House, a rescue center and orphanage for children recovered from captured slave ships and destroyed settlements.</p>
  <!-- It seemed for a while like the best way for us to establish peace was to retire all operations, me and her together acting as the public face of the group post-dissipation, since she had ambition and I had connections. I wanted so badly to be able to tell her that we would be friends forever. But tomorrow was never a guarantee. -->
