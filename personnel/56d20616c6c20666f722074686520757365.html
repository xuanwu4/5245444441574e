  <h1>ID: "The Weaver"</h1>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Secondary Codename: Anansi-8</p>
  <p>DOB: Unknown</p>
  <p>Member Since: 3/19/969</p>
  <p>Species: Homo albus caliginosus</p>
  <p>Call Command: Ensnare</p>
  <p>Height: 5'5"</p>
  <p>Weight: 65 kg.</p>
  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>The Weaver is a member of Citadel (formerly known as Pantheon), and has recieved several promotions therein over the years, beginning from an initial position of public relations intern. She now works as a direct advisor to Nephone, head of the legislative department. Her active service in Citadel makes her an invaluable spy against them, as one of the most notorious enemy organizations our group faces.</p>
  <p>Unlike The Rust, who also does large-scale spywork for our group, The Weaver's espionage focuses exclusively on strategy, including upcoming movements and assaults planned by Citadel. In her position as an advisor, she operates as a double agent, reporting on some classified information and plans of the New Txamsem to Citadel in turn. The nature and amount of information leaked to Citadel is subject to careful scrutiny by our members, as we want to release enough information to continually establish The Weaver as a reliable and trustworthy agent to Citadel while preserving the integrity of our own operations.</p>
  <p>The Weaver and The Rust do collaborate frequently to exchange information, and she is on amicable terms with all of our other members. As an expert in law, she also serves as our legal advisor, helping with ensuring that operations are planned to be as closely within the bounds of legality as they ethically can be (of course, given our purpose and ethics, we often have to operate outside the bounds of certain laws).</p>
  <p>As of April 971, she has helped us secure a formal alliance with the Patupaiarehe and Irkallan people.</p>
  <!-- I don't get it. We used to be in the same department, but she got promoted to a top position much faster, for much less work. I'm not jealous, of course- her position is an awful one to be in- but I really just want to know why she skyrocketed the ranks like that. Is it some bug in the promotion system? Because she's mortal and I'm not (anymore)? Is there some favoritism involved? She wasn't a spy for them before achieving top position, so it couldn't have been that. It's almost as if she bribed someone or had friends in high[er] places intervene. -->
