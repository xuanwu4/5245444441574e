  <h1>ID: "The Hare"</h1>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Secondary Codename: Tu Shen-7</p>
  <p>DOB: 7/22/24 BR.</p>
  <p>Member Since: 3/26/968</p>
  <p>Species: Dius olympiae</p>
  <p>Call Command: Reroll</p>
  <p>Height: 6'1"</p>
  <p>Weight: 49 kg.</p>
  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>The Tortoise and The Hare both officially joined the New Txamsem following the March 968 attack, when they were forced to move northwards to avoid Pantheon bombings. Both of them have jobs and identities outside the New Txamsem that require keeping their group identities secret, with The Hare working for Curie Unit M5 (legally required to be neutral), and The Tortoise working for Pantheon's Public Relations department.</p>
  <p>The Hare is the group assassin. Direct political intervention and infiltration missions are to be assigned to him, with the latter occasionally being accompanied by The Rust. His operations aren't as frequent as other members, not only due to the nature of his work, but due to him holding three other jobs. His work allows him, with the financial oversight of The Siren, to provide enough funding to uphold basic group operations. However, nonessential operation such as research and development projects require extraneous funding via investments and grants.</p>
  <p>Outside of their assigned missions, The Hare is an apt engineer, and is currently working on a hobby project known as the "Adam AI," which utilizes the full extent of Tower resources across two neural networks to develop an artificial human consciousness. The Hare believes that this, along with the safe storage provided by the Tower, will be a step in the right direction towards preserving the human race in an extinction-level event.</p>
  <p>Though the Adam AI utilizes resources from the Tower, The Hare does not reside therein, instead remaining in the residence of his shop, "Cog & Clover," several continents away. Because of the underground internet cable network developed by the New Txamsem for web security in the first two years of their operation, The Hare has ready and quick access to the Tower database from such a distance.</p>
  <!-- It's all such a mess. If he would just settle into one of the other bases and close up shop already, we wouldn't have to worry about this last ditch effort AI thing with "desperate god complex" painted all over it. I would get him therapy, but once again, we (i.e. he) do[es]n't have the funds. On those days I get to visit... he looks more and more disheveled. Desperately switching between three phones to try and manage each call, keep everyone one the line so he can sell some useless thing or other. What a miserable fate. -->
