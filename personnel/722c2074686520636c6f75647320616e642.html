  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>The Blood Moon is the current "leader" of the New Txamsem. This title is not necessarily one of authority, but of two roles: guilt and guidance. The primary role, guilt, dictates that in the event that the operations of the New Txamsem are completely quashed, or if any or all members are captured, The Blood Moon will take full legal blame for group operations, and exchange himself for the captive or captives. The second role, guidance, refers to The Blood Moon's primary directive within the group- being a source of direction and advice for current and future operations, as well as settling group disputes that cannot be settled through democratic decision.</p>
  <p>Though many members have advised The Blood Moon to refrain from physical appearances during operations due to the sensitive nature of his position, he frequents a combat role, alongside The Siren and The Blade. In particular, The Blood Moon specializes in area defense, and holding large grounds against waves of nonspecialized enemies.</p>
  <p>Due to a genetic disorder, The Blood Moon is the only New Txamsem member who cannot readily assume an active "war form"; instead, a prebuilt war form body exists for his usage in deep storage. Preparing for combat requires the transport of this form as well as a transfer of consciousness from his true form to the war form. For this reason, The Blood Moon cannot act as a defender in sudden-onset combat situations, but can appear during planned preemptive strikes, which usually target military facilities.</p>
  <p>Additionally, The Blood Moon is responsible for the commissioning and oversight of Project Triskelion, as well as the planned Operation Yagatarasu.</p>
