  <h1>ID: "The Blade"</h1>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>Secondary Codename: Lancelot-6</p>
  <p>DOB: 6/23/300 BR.</p>
  <p>Member Since: 6/7/968</p>
  <p>Species: Artificial Humanoid (no scientific name)</p>
  <p>Call Command: Immolate</p>
  <p>Height: 7'7"</p>
  <p>Weight: 323 kg.</p>
  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>The Blade was constructed by the woman who originally held the title of "The Weaver", and the individual who originally held the title of "The Red Dawn", two members of the original Txamsem organization. Therefore, The Blade, along with the four founding members, are considered the biological heirs of the original tribe. As the oldest member of the New Txamsem, The Blade is an invaluable source of information on the ancient world, which which she collaborates with The Rust to archive in the Tower.</p>
  <p>It should be noted, however, that The Blade as she exists in this group is paratemporal: she arrived in the year 967 alongside a group travelling from the year 973 in a divergent timeline. When this group arrived, they consorted with the current survivors of the Asteronyx cosmica ("Starsent") species, seemingly pursuing the same goal that a prior allied group was. Due to the fate of that prior group and the success of the operation the prior group pursued (which this group seemed bent on pursuing), it was deemed a temporal anomaly that this new group had arrived in this timeline, and many members went their separate ways to live semi-ordinary lives. The Blade was the only member who remained with the New Txamsem, out of a sense of kinship and duty to the members thereof, and she was named an official member as of June 968.</p>
  <p>The timeline-native version of The Blade, as far as we've heard, was destroyed by Pantheon in a raid on the coastal laboratory where she was being kept.</p>
  <p>The Blade is one of the primary combat operatives in the group, alongside The Siren. She specializes in close-quarters combat, and has joined in multiple collaborative defensive efforts alongside The Blood Moon and The Siren in the ongoing decolonization movement. Though she did not have nor request a place of permanent residence, The Weaver took it upon herself to build The Blade a personal base in an allied country. Due to her mechanical nature, The Blade should be transported to the Icefloe for repairs upon injury, rather than the Cabin or Tower.</p>
