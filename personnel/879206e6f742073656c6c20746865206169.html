  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>A little under six months after the founding of the New Txamsem, The Hare divulged his affliation thereof at a council of the Master Blood-Seers (note: The Cult of the Blood-Seers is in no way related to The Blood Moon, and far predate him choosing that name). The Ivory Tower, though not attending this council, happened to be in the same temple at the time. As she had seen The Hare pass through this temple more frequently of late, she approached to ask if he intended to become a member of the Blood Seers- and luck would have it that at such a moment, the two were walking through the temple doors, and lightning struck them both, activating a magical mechanism within a ring on The Hare's person that caused them to be randomly teleported to different locations across the planet.</p>
  <p>Once again by incredible coincidence, The Ivory Tower was warped to a location immediately adjacent to another Txamsem base, albeit several continents away. The Blood Moon, who resided there, offered her food and shelter while they organized an overseas passage to see her safely returned to her temple. In the three days she was at the base, The Blood Moon recognized her potential as a group therapist- as she offered him support with his personal struggles.</p>
  <p>The Siren, who was responsible for operating the ship to return her, also saw this potential, and demanded that The Blood Moon make her a member- at least temporarily. The Blood Moon left the decision thereof to The Ivory Tower, who, after a description of the group's purpose and operations, agreed to join, on the condition that she would not commit violent acts, and that the group make efforts to reduce their own vengeful ways.</p>
  <p>The Ivory Tower now, per her namesake, acts as the guardian and groundskeeper of <a href="https://xuanwu4.github.io/545249534b454c494f4e/tower">the Tower base</a>, a role formerly belonging to The Blood Moon, who has since transferred to a temporary alternate base as a place of residence. <a href="https://xuanwu4.github.io/545249534b454c494f4e/tower">The Tower</a> is a grand repository of data and records from history and prehistory, including files, books, images, artifacts, and recordings, as well as a development enviroment for The Hare's prototype <a href="https://xuanwu4.github.io/545249534b454c494f4e/adam">"Adam" AI</a>, which utilizes Tower resources to emulate human consciousness.</p>
  <!-- I wonder what happened to the original owner of the body she used to inhabit? And if she's still a Seer? And if she's comfortable in the new one? I know it's a bit of a... strenuous existence, being what we are, but they did everything they could to make it manageable and let us have wills of our own. Even if it was antithetical to the very purpose of our species. -->
